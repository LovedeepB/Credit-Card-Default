# Credit Card Default Classification 
This project was done using pyspark.   
Below is the abstract portion of the research paper that goes along with this analysis. It tells you what my goal was and what was the outcome of my research.

## Abstract 
Is this individual going to default on their payment next month? This is the question a lot of credit card companies have and that was the question I tried to solve using this dataset. The number of people who will default are not going to be as high as those who will not. This was the reasoning behind why I focused on the sensitivity score of the pipeline instead of the accuracy. The way I tried to solve this question is by figuring out which classification technique should be used in the pipeline to ensure the sensitivity was as high as possible. When I was done with my analysis on the dataset, I concluded that the random forest was the best at classifying the individuals.
